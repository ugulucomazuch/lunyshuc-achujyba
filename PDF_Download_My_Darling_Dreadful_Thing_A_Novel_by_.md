Johanna Van Veen is a force to be reckoned with and will stain your thoughts a brilliant shade of crimson.&amp;quot;Â  â€” Rachel Gillig, New York Times bestselling author of One Dark WindowÂ  Spirits are drawn to salt, be it blood or tears. Roos Beckman has a spirit companion only she can see. Ruthâ€”strange, corpse-like, and dead for centuriesâ€”is the light of Roos&amp;#039; life. That is, until the wealthy young widow Agnes Knoop visits one of Roos&amp;#039; backroom seances, and the two strike up a connection.Â  Soon, Roos is whisked away to the crumbling estate Agnes inherited upon the death of her husband, where an ill woman haunts the halls, strange smells drift through the air at night, and mysterious stone statues reside in the family chapel. Something dreadful festers in the manor, but still, the attraction between Roos and Agnes is undeniable.Â  Then, someone is murdered. Poor, alone, and with a history of &amp;#039;hysterics&amp;#039;, Roos is the obvious culprit. With her sanity and innocence in question, she&amp;#039;ll have to prove whoâ€”or whatâ€”is at fault or lose everything she holds dear. &amp;quot;A Sapphic sÃ©ance of preternatural proportions,Â My Darling Dreadful ThingÂ summons a stunning new literary voice to be reckoned with. Johanna van Veen reaches beyond the veil to conjure up a gothic shocker like no other.&amp;quot; â€”Â Clay McLeod Chapman, author ofÂ What Kind of MotherÂ andÂ Ghost Eaters
