Overview
Some people are just born lucky, fated to enjoy all the riches and fame, while those beneath fade into obscurity. Gongja Kim, an F-class hunter with zero skills, is definitely not one of the fortunate ones. He spends his days bemoaning his lame existence and enviously following the exploits of the star hunter Flame Emperor, for whom the mysterious, monster-filled Tower is nothing but a red carpet. Then one day, Gongja gets the chance to finally catch up to his idol when he receives the ability to copy other peopleâ€™s skills. The only catch? He has to be killed by them first!
