Two outcasts. One marriage of convenience. A love story forged in the fires of adversity. Muireallâ€¯Blair has finally found a comfortable life at Fort Harrod-until she experiences a recurring nightmare that warns of impending doom for her sister. Unable to shake the weight of foreboding, Muireall cannot sit idle anymore and risk the dream becoming a reality. With her near-sightedness a closely guarded secret, she seeks the help of Jude, a man with his own hidden past, to reach her sister. Jude Browne has been gifted with a life of fighting for survival, not one of finding acceptance. Half-blinded as a youth, the scars across his face and the knowledge of his illegitimate birth serve as a reminder of his worthlessness. However, when his mother falls ill, she finally lays bareâ€¯allâ€¯the secrets she has keptâ€¯allâ€¯his life. Secrets that point to his one chance of finding who he truly is. Jude andâ€¯Muireallâ€¯soon realize that a marriage of convenience is the key to reaching Pitman Station safely. But when their secrets unravel and danger closes in, will they succumb to the shadows of their pasts, or will they find the strength to forge a new future together?
