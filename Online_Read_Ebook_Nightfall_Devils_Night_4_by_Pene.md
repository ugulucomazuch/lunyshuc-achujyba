Overview
What happens when it&#039;s five against one and nowhere to run? The games are back in the thrilling final installment in New York Times bestselling author Penelope Douglas&#039;s Devilâ€™s Night series.â€¦
 Â 
 They call it Blackchurch. A secluded mansion in a remote, undisclosed location where the wealthy and powerful send their misbehaving sons to cool off away from prying eyes.Â 
 Â 
 Will Grayson has always been reckless, wild, and never been bound by a single rule other than to do exactly what he wanted.Â He learned long ago that being treated like an animal gives you permission to act like one. Back in high school, he mightâ€™ve enjoyed backing Emory into corners when no one was looking, but he could also be warm. And fierce in keeping her safe.Â 
 Â 
 But the truth is, he has a right to hate her.Â Because it&#039;s all her fault. Everything. Devilâ€™s Night. The videos. The arrests. She&#039;s to blameâ€”and yet she regrets nothing.
 Â 
 He never expected one of his enemies to come straight to him. But now he knows she&#039;s here somewhere.Â And as the security detail leaves and the door to the gilded cage opens, giving Will free reign of the house and grounds for another unsupervised month, he remembers with a smileâ€¦
 
 Blackchurch houses five prisoners. And he&#039;s only one of her problems.
